<h1>Edibles vs Flower vs Vapes</h1>
</header>
<main>
<p>The world of cannabis products can feel overwhelming. Here’s a quick breakdown of the three most popular formats.</p>
<h2>Flower</h2>
<p>Classic cannabis buds are versatile and provide immediate effects when smoked. Choose from sativas, indicas and hybrids to suit your mood. Perfect for traditionalists who enjoy the ritual of rolling or using a pipe.</p>
<h2>Edibles</h2>
<p>Edibles deliver cannabis in food or drinks. They produce longer‑lasting effects but take 30–90 minutes to onset. Great for a discreet experience – just start with a low dose and wait before consuming more.</p>
<h2>Vapes</h2>
<p>Vape cartridges and disposable pens heat concentrated oil, creating inhalable vapor. Vapes offer convenience, portability and fast onset without the combustion of flower.</p>
